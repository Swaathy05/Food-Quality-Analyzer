# Food Quality Analyzer

## Overview
The Food Quality Analyzer is an interactive web application designed to help users understand the nutritional content of packaged food items. It allows users to upload images of food labels, extracts the text using OCR, and provides personalized health recommendations based on user queries and dietary restrictions.

## Problem Statement
With the growing concern over health and nutrition, many consumers struggle to understand food labels and may be unaware of allergens, hidden chemicals, and nutritional breakdowns. This application aims to bridge that gap, empowering users to make informed food choices.
